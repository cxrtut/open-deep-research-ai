Thanks for running that again üôè

The fact that you still see:

error: identity column type must be smallint, integer, or bigint


means Drizzle is still trying to generate an identity column for your id. That usually happens if:

The migration SQL file already contains GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY (from your earlier schema definition).

Even though you fixed the schema to varchar("id", { length: 255 }), Drizzle is comparing with the DB and trying to reconcile with the old definition.

‚úÖ Fix path

Check your last migration file
Open drizzle/0001_stiff_lady_mastermind.sql.
If you see something like:

id varchar primary key generated by default as identity


‚Üí That‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs still an identity column.

Reset migrations (if DB is empty, safe option)
If you don‚Äôt have production data yet, delete the drizzle/ folder, drop the chats table in Neon, and regenerate from scratch:

rm -rf drizzle
npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit push


Force Drizzle to generate plain varchar primary key
Make sure your schema is exactly:

id: varchar("id", { length: 255 })
  .primaryKey()
  .$defaultFn(() => nanoid()),


‚úÖ Notice: no .notNull() and no implicit serial.

If you can‚Äôt drop the DB
Instead of push, use drizzle-kit migrate (applies incremental SQL instead of schema diff). Example:

npx drizzle-kit generate
npx drizzle-kit migrate

üîç What will fix look like in SQL?

The correct SQL Drizzle should generate is:

CREATE TYPE "status" AS ENUM ('questions', 'pending', 'processing', 'completed');

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "chats" (
  "id" varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  "clerk_user_id" varchar,
  "initial_user_message" varchar NOT NULL,
  "questions" jsonb,
  "answers" jsonb,
  "research_topic" varchar,
  "research_started_at" timestamp,
  "status" "status" DEFAULT 'questions' NOT NULL,
  "title" varchar,
  "report" varchar,
  "completed_at" timestamp,
  "cover_url" varchar,
  "sources" jsonb,
  "created_at" timestamp DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);


‚ö° Notice ‚Üí id varchar(255) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL (not an identity).

üëâ Gift, do you want me to walk you through dropping the broken table in Neon and regenerating clean migrations so you don‚Äôt keep hitting the identity column issue?
